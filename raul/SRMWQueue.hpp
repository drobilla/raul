/** Realtime-safe single-reader multi-writer queue (aka lock-free ringbuffer)
 *
 * Implemented as a dequeue in a fixed array.  Both push and pop are realtime
 * safe, but only push is threadsafe.  In other words, multiple threads can push
 * data into this queue for a single thread to consume.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally as similar to std::queue as possible, but
 * note the additional thread restrictions imposed (e.g. empty() is only
 * legal to call in the read thread).
 *
 * Obey the threading restrictions documented here, or horrible nasty (possibly
 * undetected) errors will occur.
 *
 * If you only need a single writer, use SRSWQueue.  This is slightly more
 * computationally expensive, and allocates an additional size words of memory (ie
 * if you're using this for ints or pointers etc, SRMWQueue will be twice the size
 * of SRSWQueue for the same queue size.  Additionally, the size of this queue must
 * be a power of 2 (SRSWQueue does not have this limitation).
